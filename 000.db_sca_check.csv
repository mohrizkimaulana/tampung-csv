It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group ""systemd- timesync"" needs to be created on installation of systemd. Note: The systemd-timesyncd service specifically implements only SNTP. This minimalistic service will set the system clock for large offsets or slowly adjust it for smaller deltas. More complex use cases are not covered by systemd-timesyncd.

It is recommended that PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter be set to 7 or more days.,"By restricting the frequency of password changes, an administrator can prevent users from repeatedly changing their password in an attempt to circumvent password reuse controls.",Set the PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter to 7 in /etc/login.defs: PASS_MIN_DAYS 7. Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match: # chage --mindays 7 <user>. Notes: You can also check this setting in /etc/shadow directly.

203925346,19174,cis_ubuntu20-04,Ensure password expiration warning days is 7 or more.,The PASS_WARN_AGE parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to notify users that their password will expire in a defined number of days. It is recommended that the PASS_WARN_AGE parameter be set to 7 or more days.,Providing an advance warning that a password will be expiring gives users time to think of a secure password. Users caught unaware may choose a simple password or write it down where it may be discovered.,Set the PASS_WARN_AGE parameter to 7 in /etc/login.defs: PASS_WARN_AGE 7.

203925346,19175,cis_ubuntu20-04,Ensure inactive password lock is 30 days or less.,User accounts that have been inactive for over a given period of time can be automatically disabled. It is recommended that accounts that are inactive for 30 days after password expiration be disabled.,Inactive accounts pose a threat to system security since the users are not logging in to notice failed login attempts or other anomalies.,Run the following command to set the default password inactivity period to 30 days: # useradd -D -f 30. Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match: # chage --inactive 30 <user>. Notes: You can also check this setting in /etc/shadow directly.

203925346,19176,cis_ubuntu20-04,Ensure default group for the root account is GID 0.,The usermod command can be used to specify which group the root user belongs to. This affects permissions of files that are created by the root user.,Using GID 0 for the root account helps prevent root-owned files from accidentally becoming accessible to non-privileged users.,Run the following command to set the root user default group to GID 0: # usermod -g 0 root,/etc/passwd,,,,,,passed,,,all
203925346,19177,cis_ubuntu20-04,Ensure default user umask is 027 or more restrictive.,"The default umask determines the permissions of files created by users. The user creating the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the chmod command. Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by others by default may choose a different default umask by inserting the umask command into the standard shell configuration files ( .profile , .bashrc , etc.) in their home directories.","Setting a very secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice about their file permissions. A default umask setting of 077 causes files and directories created by users to not be readable by any other user on the system. A umask of 027 would make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while a umask of 022 would make files readable by every user on the system.","Edit the /etc/bash.bashrc , /etc/profile and /etc/profile.d/*.sh files (and the appropriate files for any other shell supported on your system) and add or edit any umask parameters as follows: umask 027","/etc/bash.bashrc,/etc/profile",,/etc/profile.d,,,,passed,,,none
203925346,19178,cis_ubuntu20-04,Ensure default user shell timeout is 900 seconds or less.,The default TMOUT determines the shell timeout for users. The TMOUT value is measured in seconds.,Having no timeout value associated with a shell could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's shell session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening.,"Edit the /etc/bash.bashrc , /etc/profile and /etc/profile.d/*.sh files (and the appropriate files for any other shell supported on your system) and add or edit any umask parameters as follows: readonly TMOUT=900 ; export TMOUT .

By uncommenting the pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su, the su command will only allow users in the sudo group to execute su.","Restricting the use of su, and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via sudo, whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program.","Create an empty group that will be specified for use of the su command. The group should be named according to site policy.
